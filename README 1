# ai-case-study

# Name of company 

The name of the company is Google DeepMind. 

# When was the company incorporated?

DeepMind was founded in 2010, acquired by Google in 2014, and merged with Google AI's ""Google Brain" program in 2023, forming Google DeepMind.

# Who are the founders of the company?

The company was initially founded by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman.

# How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Demis Hassabis has stated that he started the project by teaching the AI older, more primitive games like Pong and Space Invaders. The company's goal is to create an all-purpose AI. 

# How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

The company receieved funding from multiple major Venture Capitalist firms, such as Horizons Venture and Founders Fund. By the time of it's merger in 2014, it's estimated that the company received as much as 650$ million in funding.

## Business Activities

# What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Google DeepMind has its fingers deep in many fields, including healthcare, with considerable breakthroughs in the field of protein folding, gaming (a medium to conduct extensive Reinforcment Learning), and multiple language models.

# Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Due to the wide range of technologies Google DeepMind has under it's umbrella, the market is very wide.  

# What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The unfair advantage this company has is being owned by Google, and receiving the big Google paycheck. This allows them to (within reason) poach top developers from other companies, and spend fewer resorces trying to achieve immediate commerical success. 

# Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

My favorite example is that of TacticAI,an AI system that attempts to find optimal strategies for corner kicks in soccer. It  uses geometric deep learning (deep learning that takes place in a 3d landscape, i.e. a soccer field).
 It is a system that addresses three main questions: First, for any given setup, what is the expected outcome? This explores theoretical scenarios from an initial instance of the play. Second, once a setup has been played, can it understand what has happened? Can it relate this outcome to others and learn from it? Lastly, can it adjust it's strategy based on previous information gathered? Is it capable of applying the learned information in a way that leads to more goals being scored?
 This system works by assigning the six players on field corresponding nodes in a graph representation. Each node has unique values such as position, velocity, height etc, with the weights(?) representing the relationship between the positions. It takes this starting data, feeds it into the TacticAI model, and information in relation to the 3 questions above is gathered and applied.

## Landscape

# What field is the company in?

This company spans from Healthcare to Sports, from Ethics (supposedly) to Language Modeling.

# What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 - 10 years?

Due to the scope of the project, it's closest competition is ChatGPT, with how many branches it's spawning regularly. 

# What are the other major companies in this field?

OpenAI and DeepMind share the same greater market. There are more specialized exmaples like Aleph Alpha for enterprise and governments, and Digital Diagnostics in the healthcare field. 

## Results

# What has been the business impact of this company so far?

DeepMind has made groundbreaking achievements in multiple fields. The company seems to be focusing resources on biotechnology recently, with CEO Demis Hassabis saying that the field has "enourmous economic value". They have already made advancements in screening for eye cancer, and the aforemention AlphaFold. 

# What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

DeepMind conveniently uses an AGI matrix, proposing six main variables to measure. They are focusing on capabilities, generality, performance, cognitive tasks, and real-world value.

# How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

DeepMind is lagging behind OpenAI in the NLM field, with Googles equivalent "Bard" receving very lukewarm reception, and developers stating that it was "not ready" after it's initial unveiling. As stated previously, DeepMind is excelling in the biotech field, and is leading the industry in some niches.

## Recommendations

# If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would give the not creative suggestion of continuing work on their Google Gemini program, to have a trademark interface for the general consumer base to interact with. Part of what makes ChatGPT so popular is the ease of access for the casual user, thus expanding its influence. 

# Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

While biotech/sports etc are meaningful advancements, I think expanding DeepMinds influence will benefit the company. ChatGPT is gaining name brand recognition of the service it provides, much like band-aids for bandages and Kleenex for tissues. Google wants that market presence with Bard. 

# What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Google Gemini uses Natural Language Processing and machine learning.  It's most recent models use transformer architecture, similar to GPT-4o. It also utilizes pretraining and fine-tuning, and was trained with images, audio, and videos in tandem with text training.


# Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

The listed technologies are considered the cutting edge of Natural Language Modeling refinement.
